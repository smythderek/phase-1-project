# Build Your Disney Dream Team
Search across all Disney characters to select your favorite five!

## Description
Enter the name of any Disney character in the search field -- matches are strict based on the search input. Scroll through the matches and once you find a character you want on your Dream Team, simply click Add under that character's picture. Perform as many searches as you want, and you can add up to five different characters. If there are multiple matches for a search, e.g., Cinderella returns three matches, you there's no limit to adding as many of the search results as you want.

Once characters are added to your team, hover over their picture in the Your Dream Team section to reveal more details about all programming the character has appeared in:
- Movies
- Short films
- TV shows
- Video games
- Park attractions

Each character can be removed by simply clicking the Remove button under their picture. There is no limit to the number of times you can remove/add characters (though you cannot add more characters when there are already five team members).

## Roadmap
Ideas for future improvements:
- Updated styling to improve page aesthetics
- When the team is full (five characters), disable all "Add" buttons in the search results
- Rather than showing each team member's details on hover, provide a Show/Hide details button so the details can persist regardless of mouse location
- Add bulk-remove action to clear/reset your team
- Add some effects/animations to celebrate when the team is full (five characters)
- Implement auto-complete for search
- Implement fuzzy search so typos can be forgiven via close suggested searches
- Add input field for user's name, so the page title can read "[Your name]'s Disney Dream Team"
- Support export/print, so the user can share their dream team with others
- Create an export option that is stylized in black and white with larger team pictures, to allow users to then use the page for coloring/decorating
